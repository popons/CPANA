 This document describes the CPANA software suites.

o DIRECTORIES

  cpana - PANA library
  ceap - EAP library
  clpe - library containing common miscellaneous functions for cpana
         and ceap.
  apps - contains example applications including cpaa (PAA) and cpac
         (PaC)

 See documentations files under doc/ for details. (will be available
 soon!)

o What is the CPANA?

 CPANA consists of some libraries and sample applications for PANA
 message exchange. This is provided by Toshiba Corporation. We hope it
 can run on POSIX variant OSes like Linux and *BSD.

o STANDARD REFERENCES

 Currently, CPANA supports the following specifications, but does not
 cover all details of them.

  PANA
    RFC5191 - "Protocol for Carrying Authentication for Network Access
             (PANA)"
    RFC5193 - "Protocol for Carrying Authentication for Network Access
             (PANA) Framework"
    RFC5609 - "State Machines for the Protocol for Carrying
              Authentication for Network Access (PANA)"

  EAP
    RFC3748 - "Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)"
    RFC4137 - "State Machines for EAP Peer and Authenticator"

  EAP-PSK
    RFC4764 - "The EAP-PSK Protocol: A Pre-Shared Key Extensible
              Authentication Protocol (EAP) Method"

o Install

 CPANA probably requires following libraries:

  - OpennSSL libirary
    http://wwww.openssl.org
  - 

 Building the CPANA softwares:

  You can just run the 'configure' script and 'make'.

 Install the CPANA softwares:

  After compilation, just do 'make install' as a root privilege.

o Contact Points

 Informations about CPANA are availabel at the project's web site:

  http://cpana.sourceforge.net

 If you have any questions about CPANA, you can ask to the mailing
 list:

 Basically this software suites follows the 3 clouds BSD-like
 copyright except there's special notice and the copyright holder is
 Toshiba Corporation. In short, the code is freely available but with
 no warranty.
